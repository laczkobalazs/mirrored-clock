Coding challenge!

Peter can see a clock in the mirror from the place he sits in the office. When he saw the clock shows 12:22. He knows that the time is 11:38
In the same manner:

05:25 --> 06:35
01:50 --> 10:10
11:58 --> 12:02
12:01 --> 11:59

Please create an application which solves the problem. 
Return the real time as a string.
Consider hours to be between 1 <= hour < 13.
So there is no 00:20, instead it is 12:20.
There is no 13:20, instead it is 01:20.
Please donâ€™t use Bash.
